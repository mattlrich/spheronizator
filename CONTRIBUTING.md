# Contributing

I am happy to accept contributions that fix issues or enhance the project. Please be considerate of the following when submitting code:

- All contributions are to be in the form of a GitHub pull request.
- Clearly document the issue you are fixing and the necessary steps to reproduce it.
- Only submit pull requests that fix a single issue or add a single feature at a time.
- If you are adding a new feature, please include a way to test its functionality.
- Your code submission should try to match the existing styling and organizational structire of the project.
